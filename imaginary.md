# Minikube with Multiple Containers using BusyBox

This guide will help you set up Minikube with multiple containers using BusyBox.

## Prerequisites

- Minikube installed
- kubectl installed

## Steps

1. **Start Minikube**

    ```sh
    minikube start
    ```

2. **Create a Deployment with Multiple BusyBox Containers**

    Create a file named `busybox-deployment.yaml` with the following content:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: busybox-deployment
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
         matchLabels:
            app: busybox
      template:
         metadata:
            labels:
              app: busybox
         spec:
            containers:
            - name: busybox
              image: busybox
              command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo Hello Kubernetes! && sleep 3600']
    ```

3. **Apply the Deployment**

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f busybox-deployment.yaml
    ```

4. **Verify the Deployment**

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods -l app=busybox
    ```

    You should see multiple BusyBox pods running.

## Cleanup

To delete the deployment, run:

```sh
kubectl delete -f busybox-deployment.yaml
minikube stop
```

That's it! You've successfully set up Minikube with multiple BusyBox containers.
